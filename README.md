Jonathan Allard : Blog
======================
This is the Jonathan Allard : Blog.  
Ici le Jonathan Allard : Blog.

I chose that name for its language-neutrality, between 
*Jonathan Allard's Blog*, and *Le blog de Jonathan Allard*.

This blog is served at [jonathanallard.ca](http://jonathanallard.ca).

This blog is now powered by [Jekyll][1]. It used to run on Octopress,
but I didn't really like the theme and the ten thousand bells and
whistles, so when I crafted a new theme by hand, I ended up switching.

Anything on that blog can and will change into the future. Change
tracking is not supported in the (all-too-simple) UI right now, but is
comfortably doable in this Git repository.

You might notice I make incessant tiny updates; it's in my personality
to be a perfectionist.

Pull requests for factual corrections and technical improvements
welcome. Pretty much any improvement will be welcome really.

Bonne lecture  
Jonathan Allard
