Jonathan Allard : Blog
======================
This is the Jonathan Allard : Blog.  
Ici le Jonathan Allard : Blog.

I chose that name for its language-neutrality, between Jonathan Allard's
Blog, and Le blog de Jonathan Allard.

Anything on that blog can and will change into the future. Change
tracking is not supported in the (all-too-simple) UI right now, but is
comfortably doable in this Git repository.

Pull requests for factual corrections and technical improvements
welcome. Pretty much any improvement will be welcome really.

Bonne lecture  
Jonathan Allard
