# Why My Start-Up Project Is Stalled
In December 2012, I started coding an application that is meant to become a start-up. It is stalled, and it has been for a moment now.

Rendezvous is an application that allows businesses to take appointments from clients online. So for instance, instead of calling your hairdresser for an appointment time, you go on their website and select a time that fits both of you.

> It's actually a friend of my father who gave me the idea. Or rather, the job to get such a system up.

I am stalled.

I graduated in 2012 from business school, concentrating in Information Systems and Entrepreneurship. Getting out, I couldn't find a job, went freelancing, got a job in summer 2012, got terminated, and there I was. (Couldn't get a job, and wasn't even attracted to the work-for-a-big-company model. As a hacker and lover of new shiny things (and change in general (forgive the double and triple parenthesis depth, just allow it to go there)), nice and nimble programming languages and philosophies, and stuff that moves fast in general, I wasn't exactly keen on becoming valued employee #21429.)

No job in hand, when people asked me the dreaded 'what I was doing' question, this was what I was talking about. Omitting the fact that I wasn't making any money sure, but just "working on this exciting new thing". 

I had entertained countless projects in the past, bad ideas, okay ideas, and the in-between. But this nothing I brought to end (or rather, to closure). So now, there was at least an element of shame in giving up once more. So I persisted.

Twelve months, 189 commits, 24,214 lines of code later, I don't know where I'm going / what the hell I'm doing.

## The Fright of Competition
Every once in a while, I discover a new competitor. Appointment scheduling is a worthy problem to solve, I believe, and that explains so obviously many are in the market. Executing the idea well, both in terms of product and marketing, is something else. But I get freaked out every time.

And that scares the hell out of me. Because I can just think

The other side of my brain will say: your competition is not those folks. It's pen and paper. Repeat. 95% of competition is pen and paper. Everything else is just noise. Besides, if you haven't heard about it in the mainstream by now, there is plenty of space in the market.

## Having the Time
I now contract for a small web firm in Montreal. I get a steady flow of work, but more importantly, I have more time to myself. 

Time is a weird thing. So I found this gig in July. Back when I had no job, my understanding was "I'm stressing out about finishing this because I'm scrambling to get money to pay bills." And now with a job, obviously, "I'm too busy with my full-time to have anything else on my mind." (Note to self: I shouldn't even be writing this right now, I have a project to push out in 2 days.)

So, no job from Aug '12 to Jul '13, getting gigs here and there, but nothing stable, and I'm just scrambling to pay bills and rent and food. And I remember at that time, my mind just feels like it's being cracked in two. Can I squeak through, descend a little further into money hell, and get enough traction to finish this rat race alive, or should I just put that on the back-burner and run for the exit while I find a job a Tim Horton's? For the sake of my sanity, I chose the latter. (Insert plea for Guaranteed minimum income here)

### Other history
I applied to YC S13. The probable happened. I got rejected. To be fair, my application wasn't particularly stellar. Moving on.

### Being stuck is counter-productive in the bigger picture
I come to the realization that being stuck in this state is not a productive make of my time. At worst, I could have this one fail, but at least, my time wouldn't be sucked up with this one. Actually, this is the worse. Having a zombie entertain your mind for so much time. Every hour that is wasted here is an hour that is not spent working on another project that could be successful.

## A bit of meta - more on fear of ridicule
Even as of writing this post, I am thinking: I have to get that minimum image, that website in place to at least be able to use that . There's also a domain name I'm waiting for to expire. But we'll shush this one out.

Other concern about putting an article out there, for example, is "is my blog good enough?" I've surely written some sentences in the past I could maybe be embarrassed about. (Am I that allergic to criticism and such a sucker for validation?)

### Good ol' MVP / MVP-Fu
I know that MVP, and blah. But there's always that inhibition in my mind that it's never good enough. 

The problem I perceive is my MVP isn't good enough. But it is. I can go up to someone and say, [would you pay X amount of money for this?](mckenzie) (Ironically, in quoting P Mac, I'm trying to get out a product in about the same market. It scares me sometimes when I read his stuff about his product that's similar to mine. But come back to "the real competition")

#### Be perfect
Also, I've been brought up in a certain way that what was expected of me has "to be perfect". However, being perfect is often less than efficient. 

"If you're not embarassed by your 1.0, you haven't shipped it soon enough."

I am talking about the fact that you have to go out there and stand by yourself in front of someone, put your executed-idea out there, and expose yourself to judgement. Intellectually, I am perfectly able to say, as these lines can bear witness, that rejection and criticism are fantastic tools, and rather just the process actually working! But emotionally, it's a whole other realm, especially when I (and speaking for myself) factor in my emotional baggage. (Spoiler alert: yes, bullying has its effects. But that's for another day.) Long story short: I'm scared of rejection and people. -ish.

And in pushing some features out... Process: try the app with a use case, see what are the major pain points, and solve the major kinks that would make customers go "main objection". However, does that ever end? I threw myself that way, and I thought I was going crazy with how much the abstraction can go far and you can actually, once again, end up coding too much. "When does it ever end?"

Though I could actually just go out without a computer and just a bunch of printouts and that would be my demo.

Why am I stuck here when the next steps seem so easy? Just go out there and validate. How long can that take? And yet, I'm still here. Why? And why does that happen to so many people? The literature is clear on this. Why, as someone who is informed of all of those teachings, am I still here? What's going on?

## To Co-Found or Not to Co-Found
Do I need a co-founder? Having a second brain and being able to support one another is sure a godsend. (Pre-)startups (yes?; I'm including zombies) have their hurdles of ups and downs, and a second person is nice. But at the same time, I thought, isn'T that yet another excuse not to get something out there? As people in practicality, we are by definition not perfect, so the idea that someone else can come and fill in your gaps (read: marketing?) and give some time also sure sounds nice. 

I am trying to document what is going on in the head of someone who wants to get started, seemingly has all the tools they need to move forward, but doesn't for some reason.
