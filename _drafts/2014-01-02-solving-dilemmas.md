# How I Like to Solve a Dilemma
Sometimes you have two seemingly equal options, each with pros and cons, you can't choose between.

First off, have you accounted for all factors? For this to work, you must account for all information you have in your hand at the moment. Good.

## Applying for College
Here's a story I heard in high school, when a college admissions person gave a conference:

> A student came to me and asked: "I don't know what to choose between programs X and Y! Which one should I?"
>
> I replied: "Well, just flip head or tails."
>
> "You're kidding me, right? My future depends on this, and you're telling me to flip a coin?"
>
> "It works. Here's a coin, flip. Heads is X, tails is Y."
>
> "Okay. *(flips)* Aw crap, it's Y."
>
> "Well there you have your answer. Your gut just told you you preferred program X. Apply for X instead."
>
> And she was satisfied with her result.

Sometimes you know in your gut you want to do something, you just don't allow yourself to. Maybe there's a rule you're afraid to break or some inertia you resist to change.

An alternative set of rules is you flip the coin, land on one; but the special rule is that you're allowed to turn the coin / modify the result if you want to. If you're happy with the initial result that's your way, and if not you just flip it around.

This is a good way to reveal your suppressed gut feeling, but why should you trust your gut? Why would that be such a good indicator? Which brings me to my next point.

## The Least Concern
We don't care. When you have a dilemma, it means, by definition, that option A is practically equal to option B. This situation has pretty useful properties. 

Namely, you can go and nitpick on the smallest little benefit or drawback to make your decision. Go ahead, pick a silly/fickle reason to choose option A. There you have it. They aren't equal anymore. The chosen option is now marginally better than the other one.

I use this when ordering food, for example. I'll typically hesitate between two plates. Both seem equally good. Since I'll be satisfied with either of the two, I conventionally pick the cheapest one. 

If I go one step further, and they're the same price, I just choose the first in alphabetical order. Unhappy? Switch! It's a dilemma, you can do anything you want.

## Err on the side of action
Sometimes, the options won't be truly equal. In that they're seemingly equal, but one way is better for you than the other.

For example, you might hesitate in striking up a conversation with someone you haven't met. You'll be faced with staying in your place while keeping your rejection chances at zero (perceived benefit), or running the risk of metting someone valuable, but exposing yourself to a bad experience. Seemingly equal. (Our rational minds can see why this reasoning is flawed, but this would naturally be the perceived dilemma when faced with the situation.)

However, you might have as a personal objective that you'd like to get more out of your comfort zone. Then go ahead and err on the side of "getting out of comfort zone." There are some "sides" like this we're better to err on. We have some motives and objectives in life which we know are "for the greater good". In my personal list, I have the comfort zone, but also greater emotional movement, ... For example, you might want to *err* on the side of safety. Or err on the side of justice. Many things. It all comes down to your personal objectives. The option has the marginal benefit of advancing a life objective/tactic, something you know (at a higher level) will be better for you.
